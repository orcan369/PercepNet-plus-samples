# PercepNet-plus-samples
This repository provides several noisy and PercepNet+ enhanced samples of VCTK test set,three in high SNR (SNR>14dB) condition and three in low SNR(SNRâ‰¤14dB) condition). These samples can be directly played at https://orcan369.github.io/PercepNet-plus.github.io/. We randomly select one sample from each of the two SNR conditions and provide the spectrogram for better comparison.The D-NOISE dataset(clean and noisy) is also provided.
